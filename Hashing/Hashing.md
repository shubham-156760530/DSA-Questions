# Hashing

## Usecases of Hashing-

- Hashing is useful when we have to perform search, insert and delete operations.
- These operations takes O(1) time with Hashing. It is always better than any data structure for search, insert and delete operations.
- Hashing is not useful when we have to do closest search or prefix matching things.
- Direct Address Table Method is alternative of Hashing. But Direct Address Table method has a lot of problems like-
  - It can not handle large number of values, like phone numbers. Phone numbers can be 10^10 so these many indexes are not possible.
  - It can not handle floating point numbers, strings because index can not be floating point numbers or strings.

  - We have hash table data structure which handles all these problems.
