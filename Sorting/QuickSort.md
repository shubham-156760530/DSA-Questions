#### Quick Sort

- In Quick sort partition function is complex whereas in Merge sort function is complex.
- Both Quick and Merge Sort are divide and conquer.
- Time: worst case - O(n2), average case - O(nlogn)
- Space: O(1)
- Merge Sort has worst case time complexity as O(nlogn) and Quick Sort has worst case time complexity as O(n2) but still quick sort is faster than merge sort because it is 'In place' and tail recursive algorithm.
